# recipe-project
intro html project created for https://www.theodinproject.com/

In this project I built a barebones "website" containing a homepage, and three independent recipe pages. Doing this, I was able to put practice to studied syntax and increase my familiarity with boilerplate and basic code formatting. I have begun learning good standards for git commits and how to rollback errors due to typos or missed syntax.
